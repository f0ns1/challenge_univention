# challenge_univention

i develop this challenge during the afternoon of 22/Nov/2021



A Python script should be implemented which moves all files from all members of a group to an archive folder.
 
The name of the group should be a parameter of the program.

The program should be robust, e.g. with respect to multiple invocations in short time. The events and results should be available in a log file.

The program should be installable as a Debian package and should be made available for download.
